# Energy-Recommendation-System

## A machine learning model to analyse global energy consumption data and renewable generation to recommend optimal energy sources for users

A beginner friendly Data science and machine learing project 

* Download online dataset "House consumption model" from Kaggle
* Manipulate and Visualise data using pandas to understand off-peak and peak energy usage times
* Test optimal machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, XGBoost, or Random Forest to Predict energy consumption 
* Recommend performing energy intensive activities during these off-peak times of the day
* Optimse Energy usage and expense Bills
