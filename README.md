# Energy-Recommendation-System

## A machine learning model to analyse global energy consumption data and renewable generation to recommend optimal energy sources for users

A beginner friendly Data science and machine learing project 

* Use the online dataset "Global Consumption & Renewable Generation Data" from Kaggle
* Manipulate and Visualise data using pandas to analyse Global Energy Trends
* Test optimal machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, XGBoost, or Random Forest to Predict energy consumption 
* Recommend optimal energy sources based on data
* Evaluate Renewable Adoption Rates
